# ASSIGNMENT
Question 1: Structures

   A.Define a structure named "Employee" with the following members: name (string), id (integer), salary (float). Declare a variable of the structure type and initialize its members.         Print the details of the employee.
  
   B.Write a C program to calculate the total salary of a group of employees using an array of structures. Allow the user to input the number of employees and their details. Display the      total salary.

Question 2: Nested Structures

  A.Define a structure named "Address" with members: street (string), city (string), and pin (integer). Declare another structure named "Person" with members: name (string) and address    (of type Address). Create a variable of type Person and initialize its members. Print the person's name and address details.
  B.Extend the above program to input details of multiple persons and their addresses using an array of structures. Print the details of all persons.
  
  
Question 3: Array of Structures

A.Define a structure named "Book" with members: title (string), author (string), price (double) and rating (float). Declare an array of structures to store information about multiple     books. Allow the user to input the details of the books and display them.
B.Write a C program to find the book with the highest rating and lowest price from the array of structures.

   
   
 Question 4: Pointers to Structures
 
 What is the difference between a pointer to a structure and a pointer to an array in C programming?

     

Question 5: Pointers to Structures

A.Define a structure named "Student" with members: name (string), roll (integer), and marks (float). Create a pointer to the structure and dynamically allocate memory for it. Input the details of the student using the pointer and display them.

B.Write a C program to sort an array of structures using pointers. Sort the array based on roll numbers in ascending order and display the sorted list.

Question 6: Files

 Explain the difference between text files and binary files in C programming.

Question 7: Files and Random File Access

A.Write a C program to create a text file named "data.txt" and allow the user to enter text. Append the entered text to the file.

B.Write a C program to read the contents of a text file named "data.txt" and display them on the console.

C.Write a C program to create a binary file named "students.dat" to store information about students (name, roll, and marks). Allow the user to input the details of multiple students and write them to the file.

D.Write a C program to randomly access and read the details of a student from the binary file "students.dat" based on the roll number entered by the user.

Question 8: Files and Random File Access

Create a C program to implement a file management system with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.


    

Question 9: Enumerations

A.Define an enumeration named "Month" with constants representing the months of the year. Write a C program to input a month number from the user and display the corresponding month name using the enumeration.

B.Extend the above program to print the number of days in the entered month.

Question 10: Command Line Parameters

 Write a C program that takes two command line arguments: an integer and a filename. The program should read the contents of the given file and print the first 'n' lines, where 'n' is the integer provided as a command line argument.
